Project Overview:

Berb Hike is a 2D puzzle game where players control a panda character tasked with collecting a yellow star. To reach the star, players must navigate platforms made of ice pockets, desert blocks and volcano platforms. Each platform features dice faces that either count up when the player leaves the tile or count down when the player steps onto it. This game has a climate change theme where the aim was to educate players about how their actions in the game reflect the impact of human actions on climate change and global warming in reality. Each time players leave an ice pocket tile, the ice will melt. The melting of the ice pockets increases the sea levels, which in turn impacts on climate change.
Players must strategically use the dice face mechanics to manoeuvre through the platforms and guide the panda to the star. This game is a clone of the original Breb Hike, submitted for a game jam in 2022.
